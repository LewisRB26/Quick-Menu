README

Quick Menu is an iOS shortcut that allows a small, lightweight menu to be activated and used via Back Tap or Action Button and is powered by the Shortcuts app.

Quick Menu allows multiple features to be added to action button or back tap using features already baked into iOS instead of installing apps that take up a ton of resources that could be purposed better. 

Quick Menu is also only 33 KB in size, making it run smoothly in RAM and taking up basically no memory. This is partly because its completely offline and has no tracking services.

Compatibility

1. Requires iOS 14.5+
2. Requires iPhone 8 or newer
3. Best experienced on iPhone 15 Pro on iOS 26.2 or above (action button)
4. If your iPhone does not have Action Button, enable and set it to Back Tap in Settings > Accessibility > Touch
5. For Spotify shortcut to run, Spotify needs to be installed, but the shortcut is not required
6. This is a iOS shortcut only, its not going to run as intended on macOS

Install

1. Download from GitHub
2. Export to iPhone (skip this step if you are downloading on iPhone)
3. Add the shortcut to official apple Shortcuts app
4. Scroll down to the bottom and accept the shortcut
